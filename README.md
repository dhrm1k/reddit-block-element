# reddit-block-element

To answer what it does currently, it just blocks the chat button from old.reddit., but the hopes are, as always, pretty high.

I never got the hang of how browser extensions are done. I got around to some tutorials on medium, and here I am. Also, I tried to add a '''popup.html''', but then ended up just having a script. I do plan to add a toggle button if I continue to think about this.

NOTE: It doesn't work for new.reddit.
